### Overview:
The primary objective of this project is to design and develop a comprehensive Car 
Sales Dashboard utilizing Power BI. The focus will be on creating an interactive 
platform that extracts valuable insights from visual representations of key 
performance indicators (KPIs) associated with our car sales. Through this dashboard, 
we aim to provide a user-friendly interface that empowers stakeholders to easily 
interpret and analyze crucial data, fostering informed decision-making based on a 
deeper understanding of our sales performance trends

### Requirements:

- Difference Between YTD Sales and Previous Year-to-Date (PYTD) Sales
#### 3. Average Price Analysis:
- YTD Average Price
- MTD Average Price
- YoY Growth in Average Price
- Difference Between YTD Average Price and PYTD Average Price
#### 4. Cars Sold Metrics:
- YTD Cars Sold

### Charts:
1. YTD Sales Weekly Trend: Display a line chart illustrating the weekly trend of YTD sales. The X-axis should represent weeks, and the Y-axis should show the total sales amount.
2. YTD Total Sales by Body Style: Visualize the distribution of YTD total sales across different car body styles using a Pie chart.
3. YTD Total Sales by Colour: Present the contribution of various car colours to the YTD total sales through a Pie chart.
4. YTD Cars Sold by Dealer Region: Showcase the YTD sales data based on different dealer regions using a bar chart to visualize the sales distribution geographically.

6. Details Grid Showing All Car Sales Information: Create a detailed grid that presents all relevant information for each car sale, including car model, body style, colour, sales amount, dealer region, date, etc.




### Goal:
The project goal is to implement an intuitive and dynamic Car Sales Dashboard using 
Power BI, with a focus on extracting actionable insights from visualized key 
performance indicators (KPIs). This dashboard aims to provide a centralized platform 
for stakeholders to comprehensively analyse and interpret critical data related to car 
sales. By achieving this goal, the project seeks to enhance decision-making 
processes, enabling the team to make informed and strategic choices based on a 
real-time understanding of sales performance trends and patterns.
